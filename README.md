## Strategy

### Project Goals
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates the donation of trees by visitors. The goal is to give visitors a place where they can donate trees to charities of their choice. They can keep track of how many trees they donate and how much carbon they save by doing so. Moreover, the site will educate the visitor about the importance of trees' impact on the environment.</p>  

#### Current Goals 

The current goal of this project is to create a landing page by highlighting the mission of this site. To ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible to all, and optimised for various devices. Will also encourage the visitor to sign up so they can make an impact on the environment for our future generations. 

Below is a list of goals that I will implement with the current build. 

<ol>
<li> Choice of how many trees they would like to donate with or without a personal message</li> 

<li> Choice to donate trees to their chosen tree planting charity location. </li>  

<li> Choice to gift tree donations to friends and family with a personal message or in memory of a loved one. </li> 

<li> Educate the visitor on the importance of trees, deforestation issues, and the impact of tree planting on the environment. </li> 

<li> Educate the visitor on how much they can do to reduce their carbon footprint by planting trees. </li> 

<li> A "How To" guide to plant a tree in their own garden. </li>  

<li> Encourage visitors to become regular donors or participate in tree-planting campaigns by signing up. </li> 
</ol> 
<br> 

#### Future goals 

These are the goals that will be implanted to this site in future: 

<ol> 
<li> Give users access to their account where they can see how many trees they have planted. </li> 

<li> Give a clear indication in a chart on how much they have done to make an impact on their own carbon footprint. </li> 

<li> Regularly update and improve the website based on user feedback and changing needs. </li> 

<li> Building trust by providing transparent information about how donations are used, and the impact achieved. </li> 

<li> Increase the organization's online presence and engage with a broader audience through social media. </li> 
</ol> 
<em>I may add or remove some future goals as this project progresses in the future to meet user feedback. </em> 

#### Limitations

<p>This project is based on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  Apart form Bootstrap(JS/JQuery) there is no other use of JavaScript functionality.  Therefore no data is sent to backend, this limits some of the functionality of the landing page. No monthly subscriptions, newsletter subscription or sign-up is processed. Instead the user gets a Response page to acknowledge the input.</p>
<p>I will implement the required technologies JavaScript and Backend DB in future to meet all of the Future Goals.</p>
<br>


### User Stories 
<p>To achieve this goal, I put my self as a user to create User Stories. Starting with a new user, I imagined what a first-time visitor will want from this site.  How easy it is to find out what the site is about? Is it easy to navigate? etc.  Once I had the new visitor stories then I continued the same process for a returning visitor and finally a frequent user.</p

#### As a First Time Visitor 

<ul> 
<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate the website's homepage, so that I can quickly understand its purpose and find relevant information. </li> 

<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to easily sign up on the website, so that I can get newsletters and upcoming event details via email. </li> 


<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to learn about the organization's impact, so I can understand how my involvement can make a difference. </li> 


<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to see positive testimonials or reviews, so I can build trust in the organization. </li> 
</ul> 


#### As a returning visitor 

<ul> 
<li> As a returning visitor, I want to discover new features, events, or community activities related to tree planting, so that I can stay engaged and involved. </li> 

<li> As a returning visitor, I want to see any new projects or initiatives the organisation has undertaken since my last visit. </li> 

<li> As a returning visitor, I want to easily find contact information, so I can reach out for more information if needed. </li> 
</ul> 

#### As a frequent user 

<ul> 
<li> As a frequent visitor, I want to easily share my tree planting activities on social media, so that I can inspire others to join the cause. </li> 

<li> As a frequent visitor, I want to see any special events or promotions, so I can plan my engagement with the organisation. </li> 
</ul> 
<br> 


### Research
<p>My research for the Tree Zone is centred on creating a platform that seamlessly connects environmentally conscious donors with tree planting initiatives worldwide. In terms of logistics and operations, our research involves mapping out strategic partnerships with reputable tree-planting organisations, both local and global.</p> 
<p>
Through this research, we aim to establish a robust and sustainable network of collaborators who share our commitment to global reforestation.
</p>

#### B2C
<p>
In our research for the Tree Zone's Business-to-Consumer (B2C) initiative, our primary focus is on empowering individual donors to become active contributors to global reforestation efforts. By understanding the motivations and preferences of individual donors, we aim to create a user-centric platform that facilitates easy and impactful tree donations.
</p>
<p>
The Tree Zone's technological backbone is a key focus of our research, encompassing user-friendly interfaces, secure payment gateways, and transparent tracking mechanisms. Our development process considers the integration of innovative technologies to enhance user engagement, provide real-time updates on donation impact, and ensure a seamless donor experience.
</p>

#### B2B
<p>
In our research for the Tree Zone's Business-to-Business (B2B) initiative, the primary objective is to establish impactful partnerships with corporations, governmental bodies, and organisations committed to environmental sustainability. The research involves a comprehensive exploration of the sustainability goals and corporate social responsibility (CSR) objectives of potential B2B partners, aiming to align our tree donation programmes with their strategic initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the specific needs of B2B partners, our research emphasises the development of scalable and customisable donation programs. By tailoring our approach to accommodate large-scale contributions, we aim to provide B2B partners with a meaningful and visible environmental impact, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for global reforestation efforts.
</p>
<br>

### Trade Off Chart

<p>This trade-off analysis serves as a guide for me to prioritise features in the Tree Zone project, balancing their importance with their feasibility in the overall project scope.</p>

![trade off chart](/documentation/images/trade-off-chart.png)

<p>
As this website is structured in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap only, I have added the features to the skill set needed for this project. The limitations mostly are the use of JavaScript and the back-end not being used as needed to complete this project in full. I will revise once the skill set is acquired.
</p>

## Structure

### Architecture
<p>Tree Zone, is a static user centric front-end website built using HTML5 and CSS. HTML and CSS provides a solid foundation for creating modern and visually appealing web pages. </p> 

<p>For this project I have used HTML5 semantic elements like <code> header, nav, section, article, footer,</code> and more to provide a clearer structure to the content, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly. The document structure includes essential tags like<code> html, head,</code> and <code>body,</code> along with meta tags for character set declaration and viewport settings.</p> 

<p>CSS is used to style the HTML elements, allowing for a visually pleasing and consistent design. It enables the use of media queries for responsive design, ensuring the website looks good on various devices.</p>

<p>Bootstrap 5.3.2 is also used to ensure responsive design and use of pre defined components.</p>


### User Experience Design
<p>The User Experience Design (UXD) for my project Tree Zone website reflects a deliberate and thoughtful approach to creating a visually engaging and user-friendly digital environment. Our colour palette, inspired by nature, utilises calming shades of green and blue to instill a sense of tranquillity. Typography plays a crucial role, and I opted for the clean and versatile “Open Sans” font. With a body text size of 16 pixels, we ensure optimal readability across various devices.
</p>
<p>In terms of layout, the website embraces a responsive design philosophy, employing a Bootstrap system that offers flexibility and consistency in content arrangement. This adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, following a mobile-first approach. Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, have been meticulously designed with a user-centric focus. This documentation encapsulates our commitment to a visually cohesive, accessible, and engaging user interface, fostering an enjoyable journey for our visitors.</p>

<p>

### Navigation
<p>
The navigation will be responsive and user-friendly across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience. The navigation menu is at the top of all pages and is always available to the user. On mobile devices, the navigation menu will collapse with the hamburger icon for quick navigation.
</p>
<p>
The site will have four pages: Home, Learn, Gallery, and Contact.
On the home page, users will see the hero image followed by a Call to Action (CTA) button.
</p><p>
The home page will contain information on the Tree Planting Initiative and how everyone can get involved by signing up for a pre-defined tree planting campaign or a personalised tree planting campaign to make a positive impact and reduce their carbon footprint.
</p><p>
The CTA will have “Sign Up” on it and not “Donate” as the site is not using JavaScript back-end to process any payments or donations. As this was recognised in the trade-off chart, I have decided to implement this at a later stage when I have the skills acquired in JavaScript and back-end.
The CTA “Sign Up” button will take you to a modal dialogue with the sign-up form from all pages.
</p><p>
All pages will have the same navigation menu and footer. The footer will give the user links to social media, contact information, a sitemap, and a sign-up input for a newsletter subscription.
From the navigation menu or the sitemap, you can access any page.
</p><p>
All other pages will have the relevant information for each page. The Learn page will provide educational information; the Gallery page will have pictures and photos; and the Contact page will have a form for users to contact us and a Google Map showing Tree Zone location.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
<p>I have carefully handpicked the following colour plate, as the colours perfectly align with the goals of this project.
</p>

![colour scheme](/documentation/images/colour-scheme.png)

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Teal</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The shade of blue is often symbolic of tranquillity, nature, and environmental consciousness. It is a calming and refreshing colour that aligns with the natural elements of the Earth. The specific shade can vary, but commonly used blues in tree planting contexts are reminiscent of clear skies and clean water, reinforcing the themes of sustainability and eco-friendliness.
</li>
<br>
<li>
In design, a mid-to-light shade of blue is frequently chosen to evoke a sense of trust, reliability, and a connection to the environment. This shade of blue is chosen to resonate with the organic and nurturing aspects of tree planting, creating a visual identity that promotes harmony with nature. It serves as a visual representation of the values associated with tree-planting initiatives.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>Green</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The shade of green is typically vibrant, fresh, and natural. It often mirrors the lush tones found in healthy vegetation and represents the vitality of trees and plant life. This green is symbolic of growth, renewal, and environmental sustainability.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Overall, the choice of the shade of green in tree planting materials is strategic, aiming to create a visual identity that aligns with the values of environmental stewardship and the mission of promoting a healthier, greener planet. It serves as a powerful visual cue that encourages individuals to connect with the cause and emphasises the importance of sustaining the Earth's green ecosystems.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>Brown</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The shade of brown often reflects the earthy tones found in soil, tree bark, and natural landscapes. This brown is typically warm, grounded, and reminiscent of the natural elements that contribute to the growth and sustainability of trees. The shade of brown is chosen to symbolise the connection to the earth, the roots of trees, and the foundational aspects of environmental conservation.
</li>
<br>
<li>
A medium-to-dark shade of brown is commonly used to convey a sense of stability, rootedness, and a grounded approach to sustainability. This colour choice is strategic in creating a visual identity that emphasises the importance of nurturing and protecting the environment, especially through initiatives like tree planting.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>Yellow</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The shade of yellow is often chosen to evoke feelings of warmth, optimism, and sunlight. It is typically a bright and vibrant yellow, reminiscent of the energy and positivity associated with growth and environmental stewardship. This color choice aims to symbolize hope and the promise of a greener, healthier future.
</li>
<br>
<li>
In the context of tree planting, yellow can be used to represent the life-giving qualities of sunlight, which is essential for the growth of trees. It may be incorporated into promotional materials, or branding elements to draw attention to the positive outcomes and benefits of tree planting, such as cleaner air, biodiversity, and a more sustainable environment.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<br>

### Typography

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kantumruy Pro</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Kantumruy Pro is a newly redrawn design of the first Kantumruy (published in 2013) which is a modern display Khmer typeface that is being used by small and big brands in Cambodia, as well as many non-profit organizations for their visual identities. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

![Kantumruy Pro](/documentation/images/kantumruy-pro-font.png)

<br>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cormorant</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
