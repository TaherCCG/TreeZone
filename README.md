# Strategy

## Project Goals
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates the donation of trees by visitors. The goal is to give visitors a place where they can donate trees to charities of their choice. They can keep track of how many trees they donate and how much carbon they save by doing so. Moreover, the site will educate the visitor about the importance of trees' impact on the environment.</p>  

### Current Goals 

The current goal of this project is to create a landing page by highlighting the mission of this site. To ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible to all, and optimized for various devices. Will also encourage the visitor to sign up so they can make an impact on the environment for our future generations. 

Below is a list of goals that I will implement with the current build. 

<ol>
<li> Choice of how many trees they would like to donate with or without a personal message</li> 

<li> Choice to donate trees to their chosen tree planting charity location. </li>  

<li> Choice to gift tree donations to friends and family with a personal message or in memory of a loved one. </li> 

<li> Educate the visitor on the importance of trees, deforestation issues, and the impact of tree planting on the environment. </li> 

<li> Educate the visitor on how much they can do to reduce their carbon footprint by planting trees. </li> 

<li> A "How To" guide to plant a tree in their own garden. </li>  

<li> Encourage visitors to become regular donors or participate in tree-planting campaigns by signing up. </li> 
</ol> 
<br> 

### Future goals 

These are the goals that will be implanted to this site in future: 

<ol> 
<li> Give users access to their account where they can see how many trees they have planted. </li> 

<li> Give a clear indication in a chart on how much they have done to make an impact on their own carbon footprint. </li> 

<li> Regularly update and improve the website based on user feedback and changing needs. </li> 

<li> Building trust by providing transparent information about how donations are used, and the impact achieved. </li> 

<li> Increase the organization's online presence and engage with a broader audience through social media. </li> 
</ol> 
<em>I may add or remove some future goals as this project progresses in the future to meet user feedback. </em> 

### Limitations

<p>This project is based on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  Apart form Bootstrap(JS/JQuery) there is no other use of JavaScript functionality.  Therefore no data is sent to backend, this limits some of the functionality of the landing page. No monthly subscriptions, newsletter subscription or sign-up is processed. Instead the user gets a Response page to acknowledge the input.</p>
<p>I will implement the required technologies JavaScript and Backend DB in future to meet all of the Future Goals.</p>
<br>


## User Stories 
<p>To achieve this goal, I put my self as a user to create User Stories. Starting with a new user, I imagined what a first-time visitor will want from this site.  How easy it is to find out what the site is about? Is it easy to navigate? etc.  Once I had the new visitor stories then I continued the same process for a returning visitor and finally a frequent user.</p

#### As a First Time Visitor 

<ul> 
<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate the website's homepage, so that I can quickly understand its purpose and find relevant information. </li> 

<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to easily sign up on the website, so that I can get newsletters and upcoming event details via email. </li> 


<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to learn about the organization's impact, so I can understand how my involvement can make a difference. </li> 


<li> As a first-time visitor, I want to see positive testimonials or reviews, so I can build trust in the organization. </li> 
</ul> 


#### As a returning visitor 

<ul> 
<li> As a returning visitor, I want to discover new features, events, or community activities related to tree planting, so that I can stay engaged and involved. </li> 

<li> As a returning visitor, I want to see any new projects or initiatives the organisation has undertaken since my last visit. </li> 

<li> As a returning visitor, I want to easily find contact information, so I can reach out for more information if needed. </li> 
</ul> 

#### As a frequent user 

<ul> 
<li> As a frequent visitor, I want to easily share my tree planting activities on social media, so that I can inspire others to join the cause. </li> 

<li> As a frequent visitor, I want to see any special events or promotions, so I can plan my engagement with the organisation. </li> 
</ul>

## Research
<p>Our research for the Tree Zone is centred on creating a platform that seamlessly connects environmentally conscious donors with tree planting initiatives worldwide. The foundation of this initiative lies in a detailed exploration of the environmental landscape, assessing climate conditions, soil types, and biodiversity in regions where tree planting projects are prevalent. By understanding the unique needs of different ecosystems, we aim to facilitate the donation of tree species that align with local environmental contexts, ensuring the sustained health and growth of donated trees.  In terms of logistics and operations, our research involves mapping out strategic partnerships with reputable tree-planting organisations, both local and global.</p> 
<p>
Through this research, we aim to establish a robust and sustainable network of collaborators who share our commitment to global reforestation.
</p>

### B2C
<p>
In our research for the Tree Zone's Business-to-Consumer (B2C) initiative, our primary focus is on empowering individual donors to become active contributors to global reforestation efforts. By understanding the motivations and preferences of individual donors, we aim to create a user-centric platform that facilitates easy and impactful tree donations.
</p>
<p>
The Tree Zone's technological backbone is a key focus of our research, encompassing user-friendly interfaces, secure payment gateways, and transparent tracking mechanisms. Our development process considers the integration of innovative technologies to enhance user engagement, provide real-time updates on donation impact, and ensure a seamless donor experience.
</p>

### B2B
<p>
In our research for the Tree Zone's Business-to-Business (B2B) initiative, the primary objective is to establish impactful partnerships with corporations, governmental bodies, and organisations committed to environmental sustainability. The research involves a comprehensive exploration of the sustainability goals and corporate social responsibility (CSR) objectives of potential B2B partners, aiming to align our tree donation programmes with their strategic initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the specific needs of B2B partners, our research emphasises the development of scalable and customisable donation programs. By tailoring our approach to accommodate large-scale contributions, we aim to provide B2B partners with a meaningful and visible environmental impact, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for global reforestation efforts.

### Trade Off Chart

<p>This trade-off analysis serves as a guide for me to prioritise features in the Tree Zone project, balancing their importance with their feasibility in the overall project scope.</p>

![trade off chart](/documentation/images/trade-off-chart.png)

<p>
As this website is structured in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap only, I have added the features to the skill set needed for this project. The limitations mostly are the use of JavaScript and the back-end not being used as needed to complete this project in full. I will revise once the skill set is acquired.

## Structure

### Architecture
<p>Tree Zone, is a static user centric front-end website built using HTML5 and CSS. HTML and CSS provides a solid foundation for creating modern and visually appealing web pages. </p> 

<p>For this project I have used HTML5 semantic elements like <code> header, nav, section, article, footer,</code> and more to provide a clearer structure to the content, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly. The document structure includes essential tags like<code> html, head,</code> and <code>body,</code> along with meta tags for character set declaration and viewport settings.</p> 

<p>CSS is used to style the HTML elements, allowing for a visually pleasing and consistent design. It enables the use of media queries for responsive design, ensuring the website looks good on various devices.</p>

<p>Bootstrap 5.3.2 is also used to ensure responsive design and use of pre defined components.</p>


### User Experience Design
<p>The User Experience Design (UXD) for my project Tree Zone website reflects a deliberate and thoughtful approach to creating a visually engaging and user-friendly digital environment. Our colour palette, inspired by nature, utilises calming shades of green and blue to instill a sense of tranquillity. Typography plays a crucial role, and I opted for the clean and versatile “Open Sans” font. With a body text size of 16 pixels, we ensure optimal readability across various devices.
</p>
<p>In terms of layout, the website embraces a responsive design philosophy, employing a Bootstrap system that offers flexibility and consistency in content arrangement. This adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, following a mobile-first approach. Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, have been meticulously designed with a user-centric focus. This documentation encapsulates our commitment to a visually cohesive, accessible, and engaging user interface, fostering an enjoyable journey for our visitors.</p><p>
