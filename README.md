<em>Milestone Project 1 - Tree Zone Landing Page</em>

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to give the visitors a single hub, from where they can donate trees to there choice of charity, keep track of how many trees they have donated and the impact that they can make on their carbon footprint by donating trees. The site will also educate the visitor on importance of trees impact on the environment. 

### Current Goals

The current goal of this project is to create a landing page by highlighting the mission of this site. To ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible to all, and optimized for various devices.  Will also encourage the visitor to signup so they can make an impact on the environment for our future generations.

Below is a list of goals that I will implement with the current build.

<li> Choice to donate trees to their chosen tree planting charity location.</li>

</ol>
