# Development

## Visual Studio Code (IDE)

This project was developed in VS Code, I preferred to use VS Code, as it is an integrated development environment (IDE) for creating an HTML landing page like Tree Zone due to several key advantages. Firstly, its lightweight and fast performance ensures a smooth development process, allowing for quick iterations and adjustments to the HTML code. I coded using my Linux PC and when I was away from home I used my Windows 11 laptop. The cross-platform compatibility of VS Code is advantageous for working on different operating systems.

The integrated Git support in VS Code is crucial for version control, it allowed me to track changes and collaborate seamlessly on the project. The integrated terminal and built-in debugger further contribute to a comprehensive development environment, empowering me to write, debug, and test HTML code efficiently.

## Git

Developing Tree Zone HTML landing page become a seamless and collaborative process when leveraging Git on my local PC synced with GitHub. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) serves as an excellent platform for this integration. Initiating the project, I can create a local Git repository within VS Code, allowing for version control and history tracking. As the HTML and CSS files are crafted, I can stage and commit changes locally, providing a snapshot of the project at different stages.

- Using CLI git commands

Branching and merging functionalities in Git become invaluable during the development of the Tree Zone landing page. Different features or sections of the page can be developed in separate branches, promoting parallel work. Once completed, these branches can be merged back into the main branch, creating a cohesive and well-integrated landing page.

## GitHub

The integration with GitHub adds a layer of collaboration to the development process. By creating a remote repository on GitHub, I can push local commits, ensuring a secure and centralised location for the project. This also serves as a backup mechanism for the entire project.

## GitHub Projects

My first experience using GitHub projects for Tree Zone was transformative in streamlining my development workflow. Setting up the project on GitHub was a straightforward process, creating a repository where i could plan the development of Tree Zone landing page. The version control provided by Git allowed me to track changes, work on different features concurrently, and maintain a clean and organised codebase.

GitHub projects proved to be an invaluable tool for project management. With boards, I could create customised task lists, breaking down the development process into manageable chunks. This visual representation helped me prioritize and track the progress of each feature or task, ensuring I was meeting my goals and project milestones.

Overall, GitHub projects played a pivotal role in orchestrating my development journey for Tree Zone's landing page. The transparency, collaboration features, and project management tools significantly enhanced my efficiency, fostering a more cohesive and organised development process. I found GitHub projects to be an indispensable asset in successfully bringing the Tree Zone landing page to completion.


# Agile Software Development Life Cycle

The Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the Tree Zone landing page project involves iterative and collaborative processes to ensure flexibility, responsiveness to change, and continuous improvement. Below is a concise overview of the Agile SDLC stages tailored for the Tree Zone project, including mentor feedback loops:

1. Project Planning:
   - Conduct a project kickoff meeting to define the landing page requirements and goals.
   - Create a product backlog with features and tasks.
   - Share the sprint plan with the mentor, gathering initial feedback on the proposed tasks and goals.
   - Begin development based on the agreed-upon plan.

2. Mid-Sprint Checkpoint with Mentor:
   - Hold a mid-sprint checkpoint meeting with the mentor to showcase progress and address any questions or concerns.
   - Gather feedback on the implemented features and make adjustments as necessary.
   - Incorporate mentor feedback into the next sprint planning cycle for continuous improvement.

3. Testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) :
   - Conduct continuous testing throughout each sprint.
   - Reach a stage where the Tree Zone landing page is ready for user acceptance testing.

4. Iterative Development and Feedback Loop:
   - Initiate the next sprint with revised priorities and goals based on mentor feedback.
   - Repeat the process of planning, development, and feedback, incorporating mentor insights into each iteration.
   - Embrace changes to requirements and priorities based on feedback and evolving needs.  
  
5. Deployment:
    - Deploy the landing page updates regularly to a staging environment.
    - Conduct a final review meeting with the mentor to ensure alignment with project goals.
    - Deploy the Tree Zone landing page, incorporating any last-minute adjustments or improvements suggested by the mentor.
    - Transition the project into a maintenance phase with the possibility of further iterations based on feedback.

Throughout the Agile SDLC, the mentor serves as a crucial collaborator, providing guidance, insights, and constructive feedback during regular review sessions. This iterative and feedback-driven approach ensures that the Tree Zone website evolves in alignment with project goals.
