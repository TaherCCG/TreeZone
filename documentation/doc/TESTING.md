## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

- The Call-to-Action jumbotron was overflowing at smaller screen sizes causing horizontal scroll to appear.
    - _Solution_ : Margin was set to zero changed it to 20px.

- Contact page failed W3C HTML Validator report, found duplicate ID for a forms input.  The main contact form on page and (CTA) modal form had same ID.
    - _Solution_ : Change the ID on page to something else.

### Unsolved bugs

- Lighthouse performance score need improvements.
    - _Possible solution_ : optimise images and use of JavaScript.
