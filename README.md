# TreeZone 

<em>Milestone Project 1 - Tree Zone Landing Page</em> 

## Project Goals 

The goal of this project is to give the visitors a single hub, from where they can donate trees to their choice of charity, keep track of how many trees they have donated and the impact that they can make on their carbon footprint by donating trees. The site will also educate the visitor on importance of trees impact on the environment.  

### Current Goals 

The current goal of this project is to create a landing page by highlighting the mission of this site. To ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible to all, and optimized for various devices. Will also encourage the visitor to sign up so they can make an impact on the environment for our future generations. 

Below is a list of goals that I will implement with the current build. 

<ol>
<li> Choice of how many trees they would like to donate with or without a personal message</li> 

<li> Choice to donate trees to their chosen tree planting charity location. </li>

<li> Encourage visitors to become regular donors or participate in tree-planting campaigns by signing up. </li> 
</ol>
